Reflection question 1: A pure function is one that always returns the same output given the same inputs and does not cause any side effects. 
If the render function depends on external data (like global variables or data fetched from an API), it can lead to unpredictable behavior.

This impurity can lead to unnecessary re-renders or inconsistent UI states because the component might render with outdated or incorrect values.

Reflection question 2: 
Caching with "useMemo":

You can utilize the useMemo hook to cache the foundations. This will prevent the recalculation of the foundations array on every render unless the props.inventory changes.
Example of how it would be implemented: import { useMemo } from 'react';

const foundationList = useMemo(() => {
  return Object.keys(props.inventory).filter(name => props.inventory[name].foundation);
}, [props.inventory]);

Caching the foundations array can improve performance especially if the inventory object is large or complex. Since the inventory changes infrequently recalculating the foundations on every render might be unnecessary.
